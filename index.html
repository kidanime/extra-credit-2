        <P>The third assignment was to do a animaton it was fun yet hard to think of something to animate.</P>
        
        
        <P>The fourth assignment was to create a website it was pretty easy since i knew what to do but i did had a little difficult with the photos since some of them came out blurry or too small and how to the layout on going to the next page.</P>

        <P>the fifth assignment was to do  programming with shapes which i really didn't like it was hard trying to figure out how to make it show up and changing its size and making it move but it worked out either way. </P>
       <li> <a href="https://kidanime.github.io/bouncing-bubbles/"target="_blank" rel="noopener"  </a></li>
        
       
        
       
        
        <P> the last assignment i did was a animaton for a social issue and i chose police militerizaton what i had difficult with this project was the speed of it. it was going too fast it was because i had the compostion time set to seven seconds so that was a mistake on my part. </P>
